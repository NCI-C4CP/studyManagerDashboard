<h2>EpiSphere Dashboards</h2>

<p>
Dashboards for multiple Episphere projects. 
Code at <a href="https://github.com/episphere/dashboard" target="_blank">github.com/episphere/dashboard</a>.
To make experimenting with shared libraries easier, the different dashboards are developed in subdirectories of the dashboard repository.
This is just an idea, it makes senso for more formal team-based development to fall back to the convetional gitflow model.
